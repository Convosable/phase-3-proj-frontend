# Adopt a Pet

Adopt a Pet is an application that allows the user to view the available dogs and cats from shelters as well as list a pet for adoption or adopt a pet from the list.

## Usage

Once the application is loaded, the user can use the NavBar to access either the Dogs, Cats, or Shelters components.

In the "Dogs" component, every dog that is availble for adoption will be listed along with some basic information about the dog.  There is also a form to list a dog for adoption as well as a search by id to find a specific dog.

In the "Cats" component, every cat that is availble for adoption will be listed along with some basic information about the cat.  There is also a form to list a cat for adoption as well as a search by id to find a specific cat.

In the "Shelters" component, each Shelter is shown with basic info. When the user clicks more details, all avvailble dogs for a specific shelter will be listed.

## Future Updates

In the future, it would be nice to add more animals to the database, and make a parent class of Animals so that each animal can inherit similar charicterstics.
