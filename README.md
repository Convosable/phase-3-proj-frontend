# Adopt a Pet

Adopt a Pet is an application that allows the user to view the available dogs and cats from shelters as well as list a pet for adoption or adopt a pet from the list.

## Usage

Once the application is loaded, the user can use the NavBar to access Shelters component.

In the "Shelters" component, each Shelter's name is shown as a link to its own page. When the user clicks the link, all avvailble dogs and cats for a specific shelter will be listed.

## Future Updates

In the future, it would be nice to add more animals to the database, and make a parent class of Animals so that each animal can inherit similar charicterstics.
