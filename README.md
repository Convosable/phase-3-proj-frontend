# Adopt a Pet

Adopt a Pet is an application that allows the user to view the available dogs and cats from shelters as well as list a pet for adoption or adopt a pet from the list.

## Usage

The backend database is available here: https://github.com/Convosable/phase-3-sinatra-react-project

To start the application: 
In the terminal, run:
$npm install
$npm start

## Future Updates

In the future, it would be nice to add more animals to the database, and make a parent class of Animals so that each animal can inherit similar charicterstics.
